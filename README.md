## Interactive Visualizations with rCharts

These are slides from my presentation at UseR 2014. They are fully reproducible.

```r
library(slidify); library(slidifyLibraries)
make_interactive()
slidify('index.Rmd')
```

To view the slides, you need to open a local web server.

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
